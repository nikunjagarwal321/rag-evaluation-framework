# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Evaluation Framework

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge dynamically during inference. This allows models to stay up-to-date, provide source attribution, and generate more faithful outputs.  

Our project introduces a **systematic evaluation framework** for RAG systems, focusing on the key components that impact performance:  
- Retriever architectures (sparse and dense retrievers)  
- Document chunking strategies  
- Re-ranking mechanisms  
- Retrieval depth  

By analyzing these components in isolation, the framework provides insights into trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and resource usage. This helps optimize RAG systems for knowledge-intensive applications like open-domain question answering, fact verification, and conversational AI.  

The framework aims to bridge the gap between academic benchmarks and practical deployment, offering actionable guidance for designing efficient and reliable RAG pipelines.
